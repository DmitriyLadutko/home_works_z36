Explicit is better than implicit.
Complex is better than complicated.
Sparse is better than dense.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Errors should never pass silently.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
